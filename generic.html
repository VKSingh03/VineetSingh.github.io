						<!-- <a href="generic.html" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic06.jpg" alt="" /></a> -->
						<p>This project was done as a team by Team PHOENIX, the official Aeromodelling club of NIT Jamsedpur.</p>
						<p><strong>SKILLS Learnt: </strong>Team management, leadership, sponsorship, teaching, aeromodelling, airflow analysis, SOLIDWORKS, ANSYS, XFLR5, MATLAB 3D graphs, fabrication (wood and aluminium), testing sequence design, control system design, troubleshooting failures, circuit design, BLDC and servo motor circuits, Radio Control design and operation.</p>

						<ul>
							<li>I was the Technical Head of Team PHOENIX for the year 2018-2019, and also for the SAE Aerodesign West 2019. </li>
							<li>As Technical head, I led the complete calculations and design team, and the fabrication of the aircraft model.</li>
							<li>We started with the Conceptual design based on Problem statement restrictions and requirements. I did the final conceptual model, and the form of wing design (backswept), tail design and fuselage mounting of wings. </li>
							<li>Preliminary design and calculations was done to validate the design of the model. This was done iteratively until a good theoretical value of lift was achieved. I lead the preliminary calculations for lift and drag coefficients. </li>
							<li>Then the detail design in CATIA was done by the design team members, and I did the material selection for each part of the plane, and started working on the electrical components specifications.</li>
							<li>Electrical components was selected based on the lift requirements from the calculations, and ANSYS analysis of the model. I checked multiple motor and propellor combinations and selected the one with highest thrust with lowest current requirement.</li>
							<li>Once the configuration was finalized for the complete aircraft, I started the fabrication with a team of 5 juniors under me. </li>
							<li>Balsa wood is used for the complete body of the aircraft, except the fuselage which was made from Aluminium. </li>
							<li>Once the fabrication is completed, we did a complete mounting of all the equipments, and used tennis balls to imitate humans in the aircraft, with steel plates as payload. </li>
							<li>In the first flight test, the plane lifted the complete weight that we estimated from calculations, and flight round was successful. </li>
							<li>At the final event in Van Nuys, we successfully completed 3 flight rounds, and we secured 9th rank globally amonst all the other teams. </li>
							<li>We also secured 1st rank for our Design Report and approach to design the Aircraft, and the tools that we used to validate every result. </li>

						<!-- <a href="generic.html" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic07.jpg" alt="" /></a> -->
						<p>Ojass is the annual technical fest at NIT Jamshedpur, and my team participated in multiple robotics competition and secured positions in all the events as described below. </p>
						<p><strong>SKILLS Learnt: </strong>Robot modeling, Arduino coding, sensor callibration, maze solving algorithms, controller design, wiring, fabrication</p>
											


						<h3>Bot-E-Maze: Autonomous Robot Competition</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>For this competition, an autonomous robot was supposed to follow a maze made up of black line and walls, and the robot should find the final goal.</li>
							<li>We did the project using Arduino Uno, and used 5 IR sensors for detecting the lines and the walls that the robot should follow. </li>
							<li>The inputs from all the IR sensors were used to design the Algorithm that can follow the line or wall. We used left wall follower algorithm for the wall follower.</li>
							<li>The competition arena was a 2 floor arena, and our robot was able to complete the eitire competition, and <strong>we won 2nd position among the 75+ teams</strong> that participated.</li>
						</ul>

						<h3>Shape Shifter: A mobile robot with manipulator</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>For this competition, a mobile robot with a mounted arm should be used to complete the given tasks and reach a final goal.</li>
							<li>We designed a four wheel drive robot, and designed a 4 DOF arm to be used to pickup and place objects. </li>
							<li>The competition arena had balls, square boxes, inclined slopes and rotating floor as hurdles, and we were able to complete all the challanges. </li>
							<li><strong>We won the event with 1st position among the 40+ teams</strong>  that participated in the event.</li>
						</ul>
						
						<h3>Mac Fifa: Robot playing Football</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>For this competition, a mobile robot should be used to play the game of football/soccer.</li>
							<li>We used our robot from the above event, and modified it to have more weight and a lower Centre of Mass. </li>
							<li>We used variable voltage regulator for this event to have more control on the robot speed and motion, and we made a custom controller with DPDT switches to control the robot for this event. </li>
							<li><strong>We won the event with 3rd position among the 90+ teams</strong>  that participated in the event.</li>
							<li>We also participated in the similar event at a different Institute (RVS academy) where we had to use two robots, and there we won the event with 1st position among the 30+ teams that participated. </li>
